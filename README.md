# Boozeifier

A university machine learning project that trains image classification models to detect and distinguish whether an image contains alcohol.

## Project Description

Boozeifier is an ML-powered image classifier designed to identify alcoholic beverages in images. The model is trained to classify images into two categories: those containing alcohol and those without.

## Dataset Structure

The training data is organized in the following folder structure:

```
dataset/
├── alcohol/        # Images containing alcoholic beverages
└── not_alcohol/    # Images without alcoholic beverages
```

Place your training images in the appropriate folders before training the model.
